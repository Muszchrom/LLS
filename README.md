# LLS - Low Level Stuff

This is my Raspberry Pi playground. 
Currently this application contains two classes, one of which is 
python implementation of this repo https://github.com/mo-thunderz/RotaryEncoder.
It allows for servo position adjustment with rotary encoder.

My goal is to implement high performance, real time object tracking system which works well in variable distance and tilt environments.
